/*
 * Multiple inheritance occurs when we want to inherit properties from different parent type classes.
 * In Java, we do not have the implementation of Multi-Level Inheritance. 
 * 
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * Read the explanation below: 
 * 
 * for example:
 * We have worked with calculator classes where we implemented Multi-Level Inheritance.
 * We were able to utilize MoreCalculator methods in ScientificCalculator becasue
 *      ScientificCalculator is an Extension(child) of MoreCalculator(parent). 
 * We were able to utilize Calculator methods in ScientificCalculator becasue
 *      MoreCalculator is an Extension(child) of Calculator(Parent)
 * which basically means
 *      Calculator is the Grand-Parent of ScientificCalculator;
 * or   ScientificCalculator is Grand-Child of Calculator;
 * 
 * Here we were able to access properties of parent and Grand Parent in calling class, beacuse there were no repetition of same methods.
 * 
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * In case of multi-level inheritance, it is a possibility that we are having same method names in both the parent classes and 
 * they conflict the behavior.
 * 
 *              A method()                                      B method()
 *                          extends                    extends
 *                                  c parent.method()    
 * 
 * C is getting confused which method() is being called, is it A.method() or B.method(). Hence the PROBLEM OF AMBIGUITY.
 * meaning there is a problem of confusion.
 * 
 *                                  There is a work around for it though:      INTERFACES.
