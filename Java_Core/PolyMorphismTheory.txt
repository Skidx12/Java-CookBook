Poly-Morphism
Meaning - Many Behaviour

There are two types - Complie Time (example - Method overloading)
                    - Run Time (example - Method Overriding)

If the Behaviour is defined at compile time, what methods will be executed at the time of Compilation
If the Behaviour is defined at Run time, what methods will be executed at the time of runing the program.


So your behavior of your reference
or your execution will change based on some situation.
If it is compile time, which is your method overloading,
where you decide based on the parameters at compile time itself.

In runtime, you're not sure which method will be called
because both the methods have the same name,
same parameters, something which will decide that
we'll discuss in the next video.
But that is method overriding,
which is run time polymorphism.
